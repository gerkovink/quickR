Dear all, 

This summer you will participate in the [**USS24: Statistical programming with R**](https://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/data-science-statistical-programming-with-r) course in Utrecht, the Netherlands. To realize a steeper learning curve, we will use some functionality that is not part of the base installation for `R`. The below steps guide you through installing both `R` as well as the necessary additions. 

We look forward to see you all in Utrecht,  

*The Statistical Programming with R Team*

# Steps to prepare

Bring a laptop computer to the course and make sure that you have full write access and administrator rights to the machine. We will explore programming and compiling in this course. This means that you need full access to your machine. Some corporate laptops come with limited access for their users, we therefore advice you to bring a personal laptop computer, if you have one. 

---

## **Install `R`**
`R` can be obtained [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore it needs to be installed. 

---

## **Install `RStudio` Desktop**

Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

---

## **Start RStudio and install the following packages. **

Execute the following lines of code in the console window:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "micemd", "jomo", "pan", 
                 "lme4", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "plotly", "ggplot2", "shiny", 
                 "devtools", "boot", "class", "car", "MASS", "ggplot2movies", 
                 "ISLR", "DAAG", "mice", "mitml", "miceadds"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```


If you are not sure where to execute code, use the following figure to identify the console:

<center>
  <img src="console.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 70%>
</center>

Just copy and paste the installation command and press the return key. When asked 

```{r eval = FALSE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

type `Yes` in the console and press the return key.

# What if the above does not work for me?
If all fails and you have insufficient rights to your machine, the following web-based service will offer a solution. 

1. You will receive an account to Utrecht University's [MyWorkPlace](https://myworkplace.uu.nl/). You would have access to `R` and `RStudio` there. You may need to install packages for new sessions during the course. 
2. Open a free account on [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). You can run your own cloud-based `RStudio` environment there. 

Naturally, you will need internet access for these services to be accessed. Wireless internet access will be available at the course location.
